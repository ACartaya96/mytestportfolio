# mytestportfolio
This is a rough draft of my website portfolio. 

Everything in this portfolio is a fictitious example of a portfolio with exceptions to the Skills and About sections. 
I wanted to practice my skills with a Web Design project to enforce what I have learned within the the last month.
What I have learned from this will also hopefully be carried over when I eventually make my own official portfolio in the future.
